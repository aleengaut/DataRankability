    CSV files must contain a header with the names of 
        the criteria and, respectively, in the rows, ordinal 
        or cardinal numerical information. If in doubt, access
        the example data.csv
    OBS: Each criterion can be a benefit or a cost. However, to specifically 
        analyze dominance and efficiency, increasing numerical order of the 
        criterion results in greater dominance, that is, the higher the value 
        of the criterion the better (benefit maximization).
